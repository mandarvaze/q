# Q

Quick and dirty debugging output for Elixir programmers

Inspired from [similar project](https://github.com/zestyping/q) for python

There is also a golang version [here](https://github.com/y0ssar1an/q)

<!---

Following commented for now, will enable once some version is available on
hex.pm and hexdocs

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `q` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:q, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/q](https://hexdocs.pm/q).

## FAQ

### Why `q.Q`?
It's quick to type and unlikely to cause naming collisions.

## Credit

I came across this idea via y0assar1an's golang implementation, which points to
zestyping's original package for python.

Needless to say, first I thank zestyping for the original idea.

I thank Jose Valim for creating elixir lang :)

I thank Jeffery Baird for
his [post](http://learnwithjeff.com/blog/2015/10/28/your-first-hex-package/) on
how to create hex package.
